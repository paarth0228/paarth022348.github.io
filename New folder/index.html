Vision: Elevate and excel individualsâ€™ to expertise in the field of data science and machine learning.
We here, under the dome of the club, are planning for collaborative learning by providing various platforms and practical implementation focusing on real world problems by the help of online communities as well as industry interaction in the domain such as Artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science for the development of students. With these hard skills, we are also aiming to develop soft skills like leadership, team work, project management and documentations skills.</p>
